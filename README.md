# Kinsey's SM-808

##To Run:
Please pull down this repo. Running the command `ruby sm-808.rb` will start up the app for you. Follow instructions within the program. 

##Specs:
To run specs, type `rspec`. 

##Notes:
- This took me 1 hour roughly. I did it in chunks, so it was hard to keep jumping back in. It would have been easier to
do it all in one sitting and would have taken less time. There are definitely areas and things I would want to improve (including
error handling), given I had more time to put into the project.
