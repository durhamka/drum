## To Run:
Please pull down this repo. Running the command `ruby sm-808.rb` will start up the app for you.
Install Rainbow so you can see the song play in my favorite color with `gem install 'rainbow'`.
Follow instructions within the program.

## Specs:
To run specs, type `rspec`. 

## Notes:
This took me about 2 hours all together to implement. 

### What Went Well:
- Valuing the user input
- Had a GREAT time doing it :)
- Readability. I tried to keep things as simple as possible and highly readable for other developers. There is still room for improvement, though.

### What Did Not Go Well:
- Finding the time to sit down and do it. I did it in chunks, so it was hard to keep jumping back in. It would have been easier to do it all in one sitting and would have taken less time. 

### The Future:
- Add validations. Right now, there are no validations if you enter something wrong. ie.(throwing an error if the user inputs anything other than 8 counts, not one of the available sounds)
- Creating sounds to choose from. I would love to prompt the user with a submenu screen to pick a sound from a list, vs. having them type it into the command line.
- Adding actual music to play, instead of just printing to the screen.
